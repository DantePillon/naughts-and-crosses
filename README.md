# Naughts-and-Crosses
This is a project I completed using Jetbrains Academy while I was revising my programming knowledge, It is a simple text based game of Naughts and Crosses. 

I also wrote a version which allowed playing against the computer with 3 levels. The hardest level (which is supposed to play perfectly) was plagued with some inscrutable, undetectable, imperceptible, horrible bug and I will hereafter fear and contemn recursion. I asked for help on the hyperskill discord server and one guy, who had completed it successfully himself, kindly offered to read through the code and couldn't figure it out either. I will return one day and hopefully update this repo with the working version.
